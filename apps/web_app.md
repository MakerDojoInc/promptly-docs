# Web App

Web apps are a type of application that can be built on Promptly. They are designed to take in user input, call a series of LLMs and other processors, and return a rendered output in the provided template. These are rendered as dedicated web pages that can be shared with others or can be embedded into other websites.

These can also be invoked as APIs to get the output from the chained LLMS and other processors by passing in the input values.
