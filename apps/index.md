## Apps

Promptly allows you to build complex AI applications by chaining together simple, reusable components with a visual interface. You can build applications that use LLMs, natural language processing, and other AI technologies without writing any code.

### Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to create an account on Promptly. You can do this by visiting [https://trypromptly.com](https://trypromptly.com) and clicking the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner. It is free to get started. Once you've created an account, you'll be able to create your first application.

### Creating an Application

To create an application, click on the app type you want to create under "Create a New App" section on the Apps page. You'll be prompted to give your application a name. Once you've done that, you'll be taken to the application editor.

### The Application Editor

The application editor is where you'll build your application. It consists of a canvas where you can drag and drop components, and a sidebar where you can configure the components you've added to the canvas.

#### Adding Processors

To add a processor to your application, select the processor you want to use from the dropdown above application output block. Click the "+ Processor" button next to it. A new processor will be added to the app and you will have the option to configure input and configuration for the processor. Use template variables to reference the output of other processors in the application.

#### Running Your Application

To run your application, click the "Preview" button in the top right corner of the app editor page based on the app type. Your application will render in the preview tab and you can interact with it.

#### Saving Your Application

To save your application, click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

#### Publishing Your Application

To publish your application, click the "Publish" button in the top right corner of the canvas. You'll be prompted to select the visibility level. Depending on the visibility level you publish the app with, it may be available to everyone or a select few users.

#### Deleting Your Application

To delete your application, click the "Delete" trash can icon in the app row in Apps page. You need to type "DELETE" in the confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion.
