## API Providers

An API provider on Promptly is a service that provides an API to generate text or images or any entity that provides API to perform certain tasks. For example, [Open AI](https://openai.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai/) etc., are some of the API providers that provide APIs to generate text and images using LLM models. [Promptly](https://trypromptly.com) is also one of the supported API providers that provides APIs to perform complex operations like summarizing texts, chatbots with data augmentation, etc.,

In the future, we will also be adding support for custom API providers which allows you to bring in your own API implementations to the platform

> We are constantly adding more API providers to the platform. If you would like to see a specific API provider on the platform, please let us know by reaching out to us at [contact@trypromptly.com](mailto:contact@trypromptly.com)
